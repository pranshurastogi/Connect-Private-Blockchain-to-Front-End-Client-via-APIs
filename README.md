## Why this project?
This project introduces you to the fundamentals of web APIs with Node.js frameworks. Using your own private blockchain to create a web API is a huge first step toward developing your own web applications that are consumable by a variety of web clients..

## What will I learn?
You will learn to create and manage a web API with a Node.js framework to interact with your private blockchain. You’ll get first hand experience generating API endpoints and configuring the endpoints response that can be consumable by many types of web clients. This project helps build on the skills you’ve learned so far an allow you to apply these skills using real world technologies to get hands on with the tools used to create web APIs.
